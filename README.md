# Description of the project
The aim of this project is to create a virtual environment full of visual artifacts which the user can enjoy with as they listen to music. 
The visuals in the world will be affected by the music to really immerse the user into the music being played. 
The user will be able to walk around in the space to get a better appreciation  of the visuals. 
They will also be able to interact with the environment somewhat and affect the visuals.
